# ⏱️ NeuroTimer

**NeuroTimer** is a simple Pomodoro-style timer built with ADHD and neurodivergent users in mind. It offers optional background sounds and short explanations to help you choose the best sound for your task.

This is a minimal MVP focused on helping you get into a rhythm — whether you're studying, working, or just trying to stay on track.

## 🧠 Why NeuroTimer?

Focus tools are often overwhelming or too rigid — NeuroTimer is intentionally simple. It’s made for people who benefit from structure but don’t need extra noise (unless it's brown noise).

This project was created with ADHD and neurodivergent brains in mind — light, flexible, and easy to use.
